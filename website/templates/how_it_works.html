      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion-btn">
          How does the adoption process work?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          You browse available pets, fill out an application, and once approved,
          you're connected with the shelter or foster for next steps like a
          meet-and-greet or home check.
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">Is there an adoption fee?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          Yes, the fee helps cover vaccinations, microchipping,
          spaying/neutering, and basic care. It varies by organization.
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">
          How long does the adoption process take?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          On average, the process takes between 3–10 days, depending on how
          quickly references are checked and meet-and-greets can be scheduled.
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">
          Can I adopt if I live in a different city or state?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          Some shelters allow out-of-area adoptions, but others may not.
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">
          What if the adoption doesn’t work out?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          Most shelters offer a trial period or return policy. Always check with
          the specific organization beforehand.
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">
          Are the pets vaccinated and spayed/neutered?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          Yes, in most cases. Each pet’s profile will include details about
          medical history, vaccinations, and whether they are already
          spayed/neutered.
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">
          Can I adopt a pet if I have young children?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          Absolutely! Just make sure to filter for pets that are marked as
          “kid-friendly.” We also recommend scheduling a meet-and-greet to see
          how they interact.
        </div>

        <button class="accordion-btn">
          Do I need to have a backyard to adopt?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          Not necessarily. Some pets (like larger or more active breeds) may
          need outdoor space, but many do well in apartments with regular walks
          and playtime.
